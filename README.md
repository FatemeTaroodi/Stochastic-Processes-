📘 Stochastic Processes – Course Summary
This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks and simulations related to topics covered in a Stochastic Processes course I taught during the term. The course followed the Persian textbook:

Einollah Pasha, Introduction to Stochastic Processes, Payame Noor University Press.
(کتاب "مقدمه‌ای بر فرآیندهای تصادفی" تألیف دکتر عین‌الله پاشا)

This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to stochastic models and their applications, tailored for undergraduate and graduate students in statistics and related fields.

🧠 Key Topics Covered
Review of Probability & Stochastic Processes Introduction
A refresher on probability theory and a high-level overview of stochastic processes.

Discrete-Time Markov Chains
Transition probability matrices, classification of states, recurrence, and absorbing chains.

Stationary Distributions
Long-run behavior of Markov chains, existence and uniqueness of stationary distributions.

Continuous-Time Markov Chains
Generator matrices, exponential holding times, and birth-death processes.

Renewal Theory
Fundamental concepts in renewal processes, inter-arrival times, and renewal function.

📚 Reference Textbook

Note on Code Language:
The code examples and notebooks in this repository are written primarily in Persian. This choice was made to accommodate some students in the course who were not fully comfortable with English. Comments and explanations within the code are provided in Persian to facilitate better understanding of the stochastic processes concepts covered.
